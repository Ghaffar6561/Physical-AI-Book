# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

A comprehensive technical textbook on Physical AI, humanoid robotics, and embodied intelligence.

## Overview

This repository contains a complete textbook on Physical AI and humanoid robotics. The book teaches:

- Physical AI foundations and embodied intelligence
- ROS 2 architecture for humanoid robots
- Simulation with Gazebo and NVIDIA Isaac
- Perception, control, and planning systems
- Vision-Language-Action (VLA) integration
- Sim-to-real transfer principles
- Complete capstone project with autonomous humanoid

## Structure

The textbook is organized into 5 modules:

1. **Physical AI Foundations** - Core concepts of embodied intelligence
2. **Digital Twins & Gazebo** - Robot modeling and simulation
3. **Perception & Sim-to-Real Transfer** - Sensor fusion and bridging simulation reality gap
4. **Vision-Language-Action Systems** - Integrating LLMs with robot control
5. **Capstone Project** - Complete working autonomous humanoid
