# Module 1: Physical AI Foundations

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

- [ ] Understand the fundamental differences between digital AI and Physical AI
- [ ] Explain the concept of embodied intelligence and its importance
- [ ] Describe the perception-action loop in robotic systems
- [ ] Understand why simulation is essential for safe robot development
- [ ] Get acquainted with ROS 2 core concepts (nodes, topics, services)

## Module Structure

This module is organized as follows:

1. **Embodied Intelligence** — Why physical robots are fundamentally different from digital AI systems
2. **Perception-Action Loops** — How sensors, perception, planning, and control interact
3. **Why Simulation Matters** — Digital twins as essential development tools
4. **ROS 2 Introduction** — First steps with the Robot Operating System 2
5. **Exercises** — Apply your understanding with hands-on exercises

## Why This Module Matters

If you're coming from a machine learning or software engineering background, your intuitions about building systems might mislead you in robotics. This module explains the **embodied intelligence** perspective—why a robot that can move and sense the physical world is fundamentally different from a chess engine or image classifier.

Understanding this perspective is critical. Without it, subsequent technical content (ROS 2, Gazebo, control theory) becomes mechanical—you'll learn the "how" without the "why."

## What's Next?

After completing this module, you'll have the conceptual foundations needed to build humanoid robot systems. In **Module 2: Digital Twins & Gazebo**, you'll learn how to model and simulate robots.
