# Module 1 Exercises

## Exercise 1: Explain Embodied Intelligence

**Objective**: Articulate the key differences between digital and physical AI.

**Task**: In your own words (200-300 words), explain:
1. What is embodied intelligence?
2. How is a robot different from an image classifier?
3. Why does timing matter in robotics?

**Solution**: See `exercises-answers.md`

## Exercise 2: Perception-Action Loop

**Objective**: Design and diagram a perception-action loop.

**Task**: Draw or describe the perception-action loop for one of these tasks:
- A robot grasping an object
- A robot walking and avoiding obstacles
- A robot picking up a cup and placing it on a table

Include:
- Sensors involved
- Perception processing
- Planning decisions
- Actuators controlled
- Feedback mechanisms

## Exercise 3: Simulation Fidelity Checklist

**Objective**: Evaluate whether a simulation is adequate for a given task.

**Task**: For a humanoid robot learning to walk:
1. List 5 things a simulator needs to model correctly
2. List 3 things that are hard to simulate accurately
3. Propose 2 methods to bridge the sim-to-real gap
