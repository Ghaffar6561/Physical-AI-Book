# Module 2: Digital Twins & Gazebo

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept of digital twins
- Learn Gazebo 11+ fundamentals
- Model humanoid robots using URDF
- Simulate sensors and physics

## Module Overview

This module teaches you how to create digital twins—software replicas of physical robots and environments. You'll learn to:

1. Use Gazebo to simulate physics and sensors
2. Describe robots using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
3. Model humanoid geometry, joints, and sensors
4. Run simulations that match real robot behavior (within limits)

## Why This Module Matters

Simulation is how modern robotics is developed. Before a robot can run, walk, or grasp in the real world, it must be tested in simulation. This is safer, cheaper, and faster.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to model a humanoid robot and simulate it with realistic physics and sensor output.
