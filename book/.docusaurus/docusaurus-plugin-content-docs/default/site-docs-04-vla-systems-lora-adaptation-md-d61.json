  "title": "Fine-Tuning LLMs with LoRA Adaptation",
  "description": "While few-shot prompting is powerful, sometimes you need to adapt a base Large Language Model (LLM) to a very specific domain or task. Fine-tuning is the process of updating the model's weights on a custom dataset. However, fine-tuning a full LLM with billions of parameters is computationally expensive and produces a massive new model file.",
