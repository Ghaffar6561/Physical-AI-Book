# Specification Quality Checklist: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-14
**Feature**: [Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders (while respecting domain knowledge)
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows and secondary use cases
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

All checklist items pass. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready to proceed to the planning phase.

## Notes

- No clarifications needed; user intent is clear and comprehensive
- Five user stories cover foundational learning, system design, sim-to-real transfer, VLA reasoning, and capstone execution
- 15 functional requirements and 10 success criteria provide measurable targets
- Scope, assumptions, and constraints are well-defined
- Four edge cases identified and addressed
- Specification balances technical depth with accessibility for target audience
